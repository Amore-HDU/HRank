PyTorch implementation for HRank.

An illustration of HRank. As shown in the left column, we first use test images to run through the convolutional layers to get the feature map. Then we estimate the rank of the feature maps, which is used as the criteria for filter pruning, as shown in the middle subfigure. The right subfigure illustrates the pruning process (the red filters), and fine-tuning process, in which the green filters are updated and the blue filters are frozen. 



## Abstract

Neural network pruning offers a promising prospect to facilitate deploying deep neural networks on resource-limited devices. However, existing methods are still challenged by the training inefficiency and labor cost in pruning designs, due to missing theoretical guidance of non-salient network components. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning method by exploring the High Rank of feature maps (HRank). Our HRank is inspired by the discovery that the average rank of multiple feature maps generated by a single filter is always the same, regardless of the number of image batches CNNs receive. Based on HRank, we develop a method that is mathematically formulated to prune filters with low-rank feature maps. The principle behind our pruning is that low-rank feature maps contain less information, and thus pruned results can be easily reproduced. Besides, we experimentally show that weights with high-rank feature maps contain more important information, such that even when a portion is not updated, very little damage would be done to the model performance. Without introducing any additional constraints, HRank leads to significant improvements over the state-of-the-arts in terms of FLOPs and parameters reduction, with similar accuracies. For example, with ResNet-110, we achieve a 58.2%-FLOPs  reduction by removing 59.2% of the parameters, with only a small loss of 0.14% in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10. With Res-50, we achieve a 43.8%-FLOPs reduction by removing 36.7% of the parameters, with only a loss of 1.14% in the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. 



## Running Code

In this code, you can run our models on CIFAR10 and ImageNet dataset. The code has been tested by Python 3.6, Pytorch 1.0 and CUDA 9.0 on Ubuntu 16.04.

```

After training, checkpoints and loggers can be found in the `job_dir`. The pruned model will be named `[arch]_cov[i]` for stage i, and therefore the final pruned model is the one with largest `i`.
